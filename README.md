# IBAN vendor-identification #

This repository contains an extension for the Continia Document Capture module, which is a solution for the scanning of invoices and other documents directly from inside Microsoft Dynamics Business Central/NAV.
This extention allows Document Capture to identify the vendor by IBAN. 

The requirement was to identify vendors by IBAN rather than by VAT ID. The reason for the request is that IBANs are much better 
maintained in the system and the customer has many vendors without VAT ID.

The code will be unregularly maintained or updated.

The solutions were developed by our partner [TRASER Software GmbH](https://traser-software.de/ "TRASER Software"). Many thanks for sharing. 
## Remark ##
You can use this code as it is, without any warranty or support by us, [TRASER Software GmbH](https://traser-software.de/ "TRASER Software") and [Continia Software A/S](https://www.continia.com "Continia Software"). 
You can use the IBAN vendor-identification at your own risk.
